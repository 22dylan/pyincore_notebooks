# Pyincore Jupyter Notebooks

This repository is used to store jupyter notebooks that rely on the [IN-CORE (pyincore)](https://github.com/IN-CORE) modeling framework.

### 20191219_Seaside_Dist

This notebook is used to demonstrate pyincore's multi-hazard damage capabilities. Computes building economic losses, risks, and building failure. Uses seismic-tsunami hazard at Seaside, Oregon as a testbed community. Demonstrates a variety of plotting methods including interactive spatial maps. 

### 20200728_SBN

A Spatial Bayesian Network (SBN) is constructed and implemented in a jupyter notebook. The notebook acts as an interface for the SBN. The user specifies input in two files corresponding to community and parcel level decisions. The notebook runs the SBN and the user can view the results spatailly in interactive maps.
