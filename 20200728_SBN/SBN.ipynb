    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a spatial Bayesian network (SBN) to evaluate parcel-level resilience. The SBN is applied to Seaside, Oregon and evaluates resilience against a cascading seismic-tsunami hazard. The process to develop the spatial Bayesian network is comprised of four steps:\n",
    "1. <ins>Damage infrastructure using pyIncore</ins> - Damage codes were developed to damage four infrastructure systems in Seaside (buildings, electric, transportation, and water). Where applicable, these damage codes used pyIncore.\n",
    "2. <ins>Develop operability curves and populate conditional probability tables (CPTs)</ins> - The results from the damage analysis were used to generate operability curves. Statistics on the operability curves were extracted to populate the CPTs\n",
    "3. <ins>Generate the SBN</ins> - A Bayesian network was constructed at each parcel using the resulting CPTs.\n",
    "4. <ins>Generate parcel-level maps of resilience</ins> - The SBN can then be used as a decision support tool to evaluate parcel-level resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process is outlined in the figure below. This notebook, however, demonstrates the final two steps highlighted in red. That is, a spatial Bayesian network is constructed and it is used to generate maps of resilience. \n",
    "\n",
    "![SBN Process](images/framework.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes used for the first two steps are located in the \"dev_code/\" directory and consist of the following python files:\n",
    "+ <ins>damage_building.py</ins> - damages building infrastructure and repair time analysis.\n",
    "+ <ins>damage_electric.py</ins> - damages electric infrastructure, connectivity analysis, repair time analysis.\n",
    "+ <ins>damage_transportation.py</ins> - damages transportation infrastructure, connectivity analysis, repair time analysis.\n",
    "+ <ins>damage_water.py</ins> - damages water infrastructure, connectivity analysis, repair time analysis.\n",
    "+ <ins>CPTsH5.py</ins> - populates CPTs using results from the above\n",

    "Each parel is assigned a Bayesian network with unique CPTs. The structure of a single parcel's Bayesian network is shown below. The top two layers correspond to community (blue) and parcel (green) level decisions. Functionality and repair time nodes are generated for each infrastructure system, and correspond to the operability curves. The functionality and repair time targets are used to specify a desired performance level. And the final layer is the parcel's Robustness, Rapidity, and Resilience.\n",
