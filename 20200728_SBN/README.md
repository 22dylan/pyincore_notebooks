The notebooks contained in this directory are part of a spatially explicit Bayesian network that computes parcel-level resilience 

The notebooks rely on pyincore's building, electric, transportation, and water damage capabilities.

This notebook is used to demonstrate pyincore's multi-hazard damage capabilities. Computes building economic losses, risks, and building failure. Uses seismic-tsunami hazard at Seaside, Oregon as a testbed community. Demonstrates a variety of plotting methods including interactive spatial maps.
